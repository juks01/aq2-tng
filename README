	-still able to change to old slippers with itm_flags
	 (greaves 64, old slippers 2)
	-new equip sound added
	-STILL TRYING TO FIND MODELLER for final model version

2. New weapons:
	Military MK23 SOCOM pistol

	  -able to be disabled with wp_flags (256)

	-chest damage decreased a bit with SSG and M4
	-added small gib on head shots
	
4. Weapon recoil-kickback added
	-HC in dual barrel mode +150 points

	-HC in single barrel mode +75
	-M3 +50
	-AA12 +50
	-SSG +30 (small, because no sense to make SSG better in any way)
	-M4 +10

5. Silencer item isn't count as special item
	-if you select silencer you can pick up any other item from ground
	-if you have any other item you can pick up silencer

6. Grenade hit damage
	-throwing grenade towards enemy makes a bit damage

7. Fast grappling hook for deathmatch and teamplay game modes
	-bind some button for +hook
	-can be used without changing weapon to grapple
	-using +hook command in CTF mode will change weapon to grapple (original mode)


Other code modifications
------------------------

I have started to clean up the code.
First removing some oldest comments or commented code blocks and adding some descriptive comments.

I also have made new function for weapon kickback. Vertical and horizontal kickback can be defined separately:
	void Weapon_Recoil(edict_t* ent, float vRecoil, float hRecoil)

Lasersight code recreated totally to fit the needs of the new SOCOM pistol. Added to two functions:
	void LaserActivate(edict_t* self, edict_t* lasersight)
	void LaserDeactivate(edict_t* self, edict_t* lasersight)



Future plans
------------

1. Definetely models needed for the new items before really releasing this mod
2. Repinning grenade with reload -command
3. Possibly boosting up helmet and silencer. Possibly having them with Akimbos or combined with grapple or something...
4. Most probably new items/weapons will need some rebalancing
